## Installation
1. Clone repository to your local device
2. Folders are structured already, so test by opening the index.html file in your browser. If it looks good, it's working right.

## Usage
This repo is simply a homework assignment. Feel free to inspect the code and notice how I made the website more accessible through the following updates:
* alt="" attributes on the <img> tags
* Semantic HTML5 Markup (`<header>`, `<footer>`, instead of `<div>`, etc.)
* Working `<a>` links
* `<span>` tag containing aria-label="" for the CSS background
